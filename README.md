Welcome to my collection of solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual programming event with challenging puzzles for every day of December.

This repository contains my solutions for multiple years of Advent of Code written in TypeScript. I implore you to try out the challenges yourself before looking at my solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains some plumbing code for actually running the different years and days solvers with different input, but the meat is in the `/src/solvers` directory. Here every year has its own directory with ts files for each day.

Each day default exports a `Solver` that returns a Promise the will resolve to a `Solution`.

A `Solution` printed will look like this:

```

                     *
                    /.\
                   /o..\
                   /..o\
                  /.o..o\
                  /...o.\
                 /..o....\
                 ^^^[_]^^^

In `/src/lib` you will find common utility functions I've used to solve multiple of the challenges.

## CLI

To run a specific day of a specific year with some input you can use the CLI. The main entry point is `main.tsx`. A helper shell-script `aoc` is available in the root`. You run the CLI with the following flags:

- `--year, -y <year>`

  The year to run. Defaults to current year

- `--day, -d <day>` (required)

  The day to run

- `--input, -i <input>`

  The input to read from. Defaults to stdin but can be any file. Use `-` to explicitly read from stdin

- `--help, -h`

  Prints helps message
